## **Connecting SAS/ACCESS to Oracle Autonomous Database**

This guide shows you how to configure SAS/ACCESS connectivity to Oracle Autonomous Database (ADB).   You can use this for SAS 9.4 and Viya 3.5.  

## **Prerequisites**

This document assumes the following:

- Autonomous Database (ADB) is provisioned. ADB includes Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) or Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP), or Autonomous JSON Database (AJD).  To provision ADB, see [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-database/adbsa/autonomous-provision.html#GUID-0B230036-0A05-4CA3-AF9D-97A255AE0C08).
- ADB Wallet is downloaded on your machine running SAS/ACCESS.  To download and configure the wallet see [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-data-warehouse-cloud/cswgs/autonomous-connect-download-credentials.html#GUID-B06202D2-0597-41AA-9481-3B174F75D4B1).
- Oracle Instant Client is downloaded and configured on your machine running SAS/ACCESS.  To install Oracle Instant Client see [here](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client.html).

## **Configuring with Oracle Database Client**

1. Follow the instructions from the SAS [documentation](https://documentation.sas.com/doc/en/pgmsascdc/9.4_3.5/acreldb/p1ujrhdoe1p743n12awcf7mwyg81.htm) to install and configure SAS/ACCESS Interface to Oracle.  As a prerequisite make sure that you have installed the Oracle Database Client 12.1.0.2 or higher on the SAS/ACCESS environment.

2. We first validate that the Oracle Database Client can communicate with ADB, and since it is installed on the same system as the SAS/ACCESS, it ensures that SAS/ACCESS Interface to Oracle is also configured correctly.

3. Test the Oracle Client with Oracle SQL*Plus
   `sqlplus password/\"Password\"@ConnectString`
   or
   `sqlplus /nologsql> set define off`

   `sql> connect username/password@connectString`

   ## **Connect SAS/ACCESS to ADB**

   Now that you have successfully configured the Oracle Client it is time to test SAS/ACCESS connectivity to ADB. Once the connection is established at the Oracle client layer,there is no change in configuration required from the SAS/ACCESS layer.  

   `libname oralib oracle user=admin pw=<ADB password> path=<service name from tnsnames.ora>;`

   Note: if you are using the ADB wallet, you can add the wallet directory path in the my_wallet_directory parameter as below:

   ```
   partners_low = (description= (retry_count=20)(retry_delay=3)(address=(protocol=tcps)(port=1522)(host=adb.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com))(connect_data=(service_name=bk8ui2h_partners_low.adwc.oraclecloud.com))(security=(ssl_server_cert_dn="CN=adwc.uscom-east-1.oraclecloud.com, OU=Oracle BMCS US, O=Oracle Corporation, L=Redwood City, ST=California, C=US")(MY_WALLET_DIRECTORY=C:\DATA\WALLET\Wallet_ADWPTR)))
   ```



4. Test out the connectivity using a tool like SAS Studio and run the following script to connect to ADB.

![test-results](./images/test-results.png)

## **Connect from CAS to ADB**

Use caslib to add an Oracle Autonomous Database as a data source for SAS Cloud Analytic Service.

The below path should be your ADB service name with parameter my_wallet_directory included.

```
caslib orcaslib desc='Oracle Caslib'    
datasource=(srctype='oracle'               
username='admin'               
password='myPwd'               
path="partners_low");
```

You are now ready to start exploring and visualizing your data.
